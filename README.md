# Middler | TCP Client-Host Virtualization Bridge
Middler allows tcp connections between client and host, happen on a virtual layer. 

## What does Middler?
Middler actually seem like it does what ngrok does, but it's not working the same way. 

Middler has a main server called Middler Tunnel. It's responsible for creating virtual hosts that represents real hosts. Tunnel creates a virtual host once a Middler Connector connects to the Tunnel. Connector is responsible for creating virtual clients that represents real clients on host's machine.
